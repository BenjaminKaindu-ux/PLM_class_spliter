"""Central configuration for the PLM Factory agents.

Model assignments (updated 2026-09-07):
- Retrieval agent embeddings: BAAI/bge-m3, called via HF Inference API
  (huggingface_hub.InferenceClient.feature_extraction, provider="hf-inference") — not
  loaded locally. Switched from stella_en_1.5B_v5 (local sentence-transformers) after
  a transformers-version incompatibility broke stella's custom remote code, and because
  the Space needs an API-backed embedding model rather than a local 1.5B+ model.
  Qwen3-Embedding-4B was considered but has no live HF Inference Provider mapping.
- Research agent + PLM agent: Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct via HF Inference API.

Auth: HF token comes from the local `hf auth login` credential store or the HF_TOKEN
environment variable. NEVER hard-code tokens in this repo.
